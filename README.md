# Expense Tracker and Budget Planner

## Description
This project is an Expense Tracker and Budget Planner tool designed to help users categorize and track their expenses, set budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits. The tool leverages machine learning algorithms to predict future expenses and categorize spending patterns.

## Features
- **Expense Tracking:** Record and manage your daily expenses with ease.
- **Budget Planning:** Set budgets for different categories and track your spending against these budgets.
- **Expense Categorization:** Automatically categorize expenses using K-Means Clustering.
- **Expense Prediction:** Predict future expenses using Gradient Boosting Regression.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize your spending habits with various charts and graphs.

## Algorithms
- **Gradient Boosting Regression:** Used to predict future expenses based on historical data.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Used to categorize expenses into different clusters for better analysis and insights.

## Technologies
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating visualizations and charts.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of the transaction.
- `Description`: A brief description of the transaction.
- `Amount`: The amount spent or received.
- `Transaction Type`: Type of transaction (e.g., debit, credit).
- `Category`: The category of the transaction (e.g., food, utilities).
- `Account Name`: The name of the account used for the transaction.

The data starts from 01/01/2018.
